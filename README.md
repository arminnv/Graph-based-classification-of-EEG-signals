## Graph-Based Classification of EEG Signals in a BCI System

This repository contains the paper "Graph-Based Classification of EEG Signals in a BCI System" and its related materials. The paper is based on my BSc project at Sharif University of Technology, in which I implemented and developed various EEG classification algorithms for scarce data. The code for this paper will be made available after the paper is published.

## Overall flow of our proposed method
